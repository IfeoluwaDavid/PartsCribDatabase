	<H3>Week 5 - Technical Report Structure (Feb. 26th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">The graded deliverables for this week include the Technical Report Structure, Project Introduction, Declaration of
	Authorship and the Abstract. The technical report structure is simply an outline of the kind of content to be expected in the actual technical 
	report document itself. The project introduction basically gives a brief description and general background of the project. It also states briefly, 
	the problems identified, the solution, as well as the method of approach. And finally the declaration of authorship, stating that the project and 
	all other resources used in its development are authentic and original ideas from us; the team members. We have put all 4 of these materials 
	together in one document attached below.</p>

	<H3>Week 2 - Project Proposal Revision (Feb. 5th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">Generally, the plan was to carry out a thorough revision of our project proposal from the previous semester in the areas of 
	the budget involved, parts required, functionalities implemented etc. However, not too much has changed in our project proposal, except in the 
	area of the functionalities implemented. We ended up stripping off some features we thought would be a good idea from the start, but they eventually 
	turned out to be not-so-necessary. A copy of our revised proposal document is attached in the URL below.</p>

	<H3>Week 1 - Final Semester Begins (Jan. 29th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">The new semester begins here. We'll be continuing on the same Parts Crib Database Project in a different course, CENG 355 i.e.
	Computer Systems Project. The team focus for this semester will be more software inclined; ensuring that we further develop the web application to
	its full functionality just as we did in the previous semester with the mobile application in a CENG 319. My team members remain Mohand Ferawana
	and Tosin Ajayi. No graded deliverables are expected upon resumption this week.</p>

	<H3>Week 11 - Individual Final Presentations (Jan. 12th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week, we individually had to demo our final presentation with the project hardware all set up and working. I demonstrated 
	my USB Barcode Scanner with some randomly generated barcode IDs registered in the remote online database using the Web application. It all worked
	fine and returned the expected results. The Powerpoint slides used in the presentation are hyperlinked below as well as a URL to the web application.</p>

	<H3>Week 10 - Individual Progress Report (Dec. 22nd)</H3>
	<p align="justify">
		<br><b>Work Achieved So Far:</b><br>
		The USB barcode scanner can recognize any type of barcode ID and read it into any text field in less than a second. When a barcode ID is 
		scanned into the web application’s text field, the data returned includes: username, first name, last name, email, number of items in 
		student’s possession, list of equipment in possession, user status i.e. Admin/student etc.<br><br>
		
		<b>Recent project activities with reference to project schedule:</b><br>
		At the moment, the hardware set up section of the project is complete. I’ve done some testing on the USB barcode scanner to ensure its 
		fast enough and the data it reads into the web application is accurate. Initially, I expected the barcode scanner to require a python script 
		or something similar in order to carry out the basic functions I expect it to carry out, but fortunately, when connected to the raspberry Pi 
		and tested with a text field on the web application it reads in the scanned data accurately and automatically triggers the exchange of data 
		between the web application and the online remote database. No scripts needed. This is exactly what sped up my progress on the hardware set 
		up aspect.<br><br>
		
		<b>Current progress in meeting project objectives as defined in proposal:</b><br>
		In terms of meeting the project objectives, all that needs to be done right now is to further develop the web application and ensure it has 
		all the features and functionalities to be used administratively. Because the USB barcode scanner would only be used by administrative users 
		on the web application. So the usefulness of the hardware sort of depends on the efficiency of the web application.<br><br>
		
		<b>Description of problems/opportunities encountered & solution plans:</b><br>
		For now, no serious problems encountered, neither have I taken note of any major opportunity. The only thing I might like to address, or do 
		something about, is to create a casing for USB barcode scanner module just for protection purpose and reduce tendencies of any kind of damage. 
		Because right now, it looks more like a “Part” than a “Product”. So I’ll consider fixing that, provided I can complete the other important 
		areas of work to be done.<br><br>
		
		<b>Financial updates on project funds + significant budget variances:</b><br>
		So far, the project funds remain the same as proposed. No extra cost required. The Raspberry Pi and the USB Barcode Scanner Module are still 
		the only major parts required for this set up. So I haven’t in any way gone above or below necessary budget. The only aspect that seems to 
		require a little more funds on a monthly basis will be the subscription for the online remote server. But it’s not considered a required 
		hardware part for the project so, I don’t really consider that to be extra cost.<br><br>
	</p>

	<H3>Week 9 - Individual Build Video Due (Dec. 15nth)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week, we had to show a very brief video of our project set up and testing procedure. My USB Barcode scanner simply
	scans in registered barcode ID's into my web application's text field and automatically triggers an action that retrieves from the remote
	database, all the user data attached to that barcode ID. I tested both valid and invalid barcode ids to see if the exchange of data between
	my web application and the remote server was actually successful, and it worked perfectly fine. The embedded video below shows that.</p>

	<H3>Week 8 - Group Placard & Video Script (Dec. 8th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week, adjustments were made to the PCB board (Cutting traces), the group placard and video script were also due. The 
	group placard is a graphical respresentation of a brief description of the Parts Crib Database + USB Barcode Scanner project. It also shows 
	the hardware materials required for the set up as well as the names of the team members involved. Below is a photo of the group placard as well
	as a brief video script explaining what is to be expected in the build video due next week.</p>

	<p align="justify">
		<br><b>Video Script Introduction:</b><br>
		After a short opening title screen with the project name and student name. I’ll be starting off by giving a brief description on 
		what the project is about and what exactly I’m trying to achieve. Like so.<br><br>
		
		My name is Ifeoluwa David Adese, and this is a build video for my Parts Crib Database project. In this video, we’ll be focusing on 
		the Hardware Section of the project, which is the set up and activation of the USB Barcode Scanner Module. This project is specifically 
		designed to serve as an authentication process for students trying to borrow equipment from the school’s engineering parts crib. The 
		barcode scanner simply has to recognize and scan in valid barcode IDs on student cards into a software application in order to fetch 
		valid information from a remote server concerning every student. The fetched data could be equipment in possession, equipment quantity, 
		student profile information etc.<br><br>
		
		<b>A few seconds of the parts that arrived:</b><br>
		So, the major parts required for the hardware set-up of this project are just the Raspberry Pi 3 console and the USB Barcode Scanner Module. 
		I got the Raspberry Pi 3 console off Amazon directly from the Canakit manufacturers for slightly over $100 and the USB Barcode scanner module 
		from Adafruit for close to $100, both including shipping fees plus tax and all. The Raspberry Pi also comes with some other important parts 
		like the Power Adapter, the Casing, the HDMI cable as well as a Micro SD Card and an SD card reader.<br><br>
		
		<b>A few seconds of the parts assembly:</b><br>
		For assembling these parts together, some other external materials might be needed, although not necessarily if you already have a static IP 
		address for your raspberry Pi. But in this scenario, the Pi’s IP address is not yet configured to be static, so we’ll need a VGA to HDMI 
		cable, an Ethernet Cable and a USB to Ethernet cable adapter. The purpose of the VGA to HDMI cable is simply to help connect the raspberry pi 
		to a computer from the Pi’s HDMI port to the computer’s VGA port. This way we can view the raspberry pi’s operating system and gain access to 
		its in-built command line terminal. Now, the USB to Ethernet cable adapter will be connected to the Ethernet Cable first. So, as one cable, 
		they can again connect the raspberry pi to a computer, but this time for a different purpose which is Network sharing. The USB Barcode Scanner 
		module will simply be connected to one of the Raspberry Pi’s USB Port. Now the Raspberry Pi’s power adapter can be connected for power up.<br><br>
		
		<b>A few seconds of the power up and the functionality you plan to demonstrate:</b><br>
		After connecting the Raspberry Pi’s power adapter for power up, we can switch views on the computer’s VGA settings till we can see the 
		Raspberry Pi’s power up process during load up. We’ll open up the Pi’s command line terminal and then load up the program files and scripts 
		needed to activate the USB barcode scanner’s functionality. At the moment, all we’re trying to do is ensure that the USB Barcode scanner can 
		successfully scan in printed barcode IDs into a web application’s text field and we already have a web application we can use to demonstrate 
		that. I’ll also briefly run through how our barcode IDs where generated as well as the logic behind the program script used to activate the 
		barcode scanner.<br><br>

	<H3>Week 7 - Individual PCB Demo Due (Dec. 1st)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week, our individual PCB Boards where expected to be finished i.e. including complete individual testing for shorts
	and open circuits, as well as configuration with the raspberry pi module. We were given a sample C code, the "traffic2B.c", which initially 
	activates an interchanging red and green light blink on the LED. We also used the same program to explore the sensor readings on the PCB board
	i.e. temperature, light and heat. First, we had to set up the Raspberry Pi Operating system by formatting the SD card, installing the support
	driver files required and then installing the VNC viewer. This way it was easy to operate on the raspberry pi console using ethernet connection
	sharing via my laptop. The screenshots below show images of the programs run and the LED blink outputs on the raspberry pi.</p>

	<H3>Week 6 - Assembling & Soldering (Nov. 24th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (After strike), we simply continued the soldering process for the PCB board, which is expected to be finished 
	and tested by next week, December 1st. During the strike, due to lack of resources to proceed with the soldering process and the assembling 
	of the hardware materials, we decided to keep working on the project by developing the web application and mobile application, which will 
	serve as a medium of communication between our hardware product and our online remote server. This aspect is also yet to be completed. Below
	is a link to our progress so far.</p>

	<H3>Week 5 - Proof of Components Acquired (Oct. 13th)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week (Before strike), our various project-required materials were delivered and checked by the instructor this week. 
	Mine specifically was a Raspberry Pi 3 Console from CanaKit and a USB compatible Barcode Scanner module by AdaFruit. We also requested for 
	our PCB Board and Student Sense Hat kits from the Parts Crib. We edited and sent the schematic guide for the board to them and picked it up 
	a few days later. At the moment, we're still in the soldering process and we expect it to be finished and tested after the upcoming strike.</p>

	<p align="justify"> No classes held this week</p>
	
	<H3>Week 4 - Individual Budget Report Due</H3>
	<p align="justify">The Budget Report for the Parts Crib Database project shows the all the infomation on cost for the required hardware 
	materials needed to set up a functional USB barcode reader to read in linear barcode IDs into our web/mobile application. The main parts 
	required are just the USB Barcode Scanner Module with CCD Camera and the Raspberry PI 3 model kit which includes other sub parts like the 
	casing, the power adapter, a micro SD card, a micro SD USB reader and a HDMI cable. Below is a detailed display of the budget for each part.</p>

	<H3>Week 3 - Project Timeline Scheduling (Gantt Chart)</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week we handed in our Project Scheduling Report in a Gantt Chart format using Microsoft Project. It shows a 
	collection of project-related tasks with their individual start dates and finish dates as well as their predecessors and time durations. 
	It covers the 2 courses in different semesters i.e. CENG 317 and CENG 355 from Semester 5 and 6. Most of these tasks are dependent on the 
	previous tasks (the week before), and they are to be completed on a weekly basis. Once in a while there could be cause to drift away from 
	the normal planned schedule. But for now, this is how myself and my group plan to operate.</p>

	<H3>Week 2 - Project Proposal Submission</H3>
	<p align="justify">We handed in a Proposal letter for the approval of our selected project i.e. The Parts Crib Database, based on a 
	specific template given to us by the instructor. The proposal sheds light on the project topic & background, the intended purchases, the 
	budgeting, and most importantly the problem addressed. It also explains in detail, how we plan to develop and bring different technical 
	components together to function as one. These components include our database, the web application, mobile application and some Hardware 
	components. The main objective of this proposal is to give a clear overview of how this project is planned to unfold from start to finish.</p>

	<H3>Week 1 - Github Installation and Repository Set Up</H3>
	<p align="justify">This week we started off with the installation and set up for our Github repositories. We created online repositories, 
	cloned into our Github Desktop application which then downloads our data to the PC drive/external drive based on a selected location. This 
	synchronized method of data storage between our device and the Github cloud repositories (Online) makes the modification of our project related 
	materials much more easier. We also set up individual web pages based on a certain web template given to us by the instructor, in order to 
	upload records of our weekly progress for our selected project.</p>
