	<H3>Week 2 - Project Proposal Submission</H3>
	<p>We handed in a Proposal letter for the approval of our selected project i.e. The Parts Crib Database, based on a specific template given to us 
by the instructor. The proposal sheds light on the project topic & background, the intended purchases, the budgeting, and most importantly the 
problem addressed. It also explains in detail, how we plan to develop and bring different technical components together to function as one. These 
components include our database, the web application, mobile application and some Hardware components. The main objective of this proposal is to 
give a clear overview of how this project is planned to unfold from start to finish.</p>

	<H3>Week 1 - Github Installation and Repository Set Up</H3>
	<p>This week we started off with the installation and set up for our Github repositories. We created online repositories, cloned into our Github Desktop
application which then downloads our data to the PC drive/external drive based on a selected location. This synchronized method of data storage between 
our device and the Github cloud repositories (Online) makes the modification of our project related materials much more easier. We also set up individual 
web pages based on a certain web template given to us by the instructor, in order to upload records of our weekly progress for our selected project.</p>
